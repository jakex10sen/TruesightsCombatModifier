# TruesightsCombatModifier
World of Warcraft addon for RP combat


# Install 

1. Download <code>.zip</code> and unzip it
2. Copy entire file to <code>/World of Wacraft/interface/addons</code>
3. Start World of Warcraft and make sure TruesightsCombatModifier is enabled

# How to use
So far you can type <code>/tcm</code> to load the buttons for battle. 

The begin button needs to hit before the other two will work. All buttons require you to have someone targeted. Targeting yourself works right now. Once you have hit the <code>begin</code> button once you can start swinging away at people.

If you wish to know your current hp you can type <code>/tcm health</code>
